\begin{abstract}
Landsat 8 is a promising candidate to address the remote sensing of inland and coastal waters (Case 2 waters) due to its improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), spectral resolution, bit quantization, and high spatial resolution. Atmospheric correction is essential for remote sensing of water since the signal from the water reaching the sensor is small compared to atmospheric scattering. Standard atmospheric correction algorithms fail over highly turbid Case 2 waters because the black pixel assumption, i.e. the signal leaving the water is zero beyond near infrared (NIR), is not always satisfied. We developed a new atmospheric correction algorithm, the model-based ELM (MoB-ELM), for Landsat 8 imagery based on the empirical line method (ELM) that does not rely on the black pixel assumption. This algorithm uses pseudo-invariant features (PIF) from the image, ground-truth data, and water-leaving reflectances from an in-water radiative transfer model (Hidrolight) to determine reflectance and radiance values of the bright and dark pixels used in the ELM method.  We compare the results with in situ remote sensing reflectance measurements for different water bodies that exhibit a range of optical properties. We calculate reflectance errors for each band taking the in situ data as ground-truth, and then compare them to results from standard atmospheric correction algorithms. These reflectance errors are small in all the visible bands for a wide range of concentrations. These results show that our atmospheric correction algorithm allows one to use Landsat 8 to study Case 2 waters as an alternative to traditional ocean color satellites (e.g. MODIS, SeaWiFS).

\section{INTRODUCTION}
\label{sec:intro}  % \label{} allows reference to this section

The bands used for the SeaDAS processing were the SWIR1 and SWIR2 because there is some contribution from the NIR band due the highly turbid water in the ponds and water-leaving radiance signal cannot be considered negligible.

Concentration range for Chl in the dataset used for the parameters of the band ratio algorithm does not contain high values > 50mg/L?

Field data: SVC radiometer following the procedures suggested by Mobley, which include three different measurements, Ed, Lw, Lrefsky.
