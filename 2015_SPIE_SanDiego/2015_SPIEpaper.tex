\begin{abstract}
Landsat 8 is a promising candidate to address the remote sensing of inland and coastal waters (Case 2 waters) due to its improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), spectral resolution, bit quantization, and high spatial resolution. Atmospheric correction is essential for remote sensing of water since the signal from the water reaching the sensor is small compared to atmospheric scattering. Standard atmospheric correction algorithms fail over highly turbid Case 2 waters because the black pixel assumption, i.e. the signal leaving the water is zero beyond near infrared (NIR), is not always satisfied. We developed a new atmospheric correction algorithm, the model-based ELM (MoB-ELM), for Landsat 8 imagery based on the empirical line method (ELM) that does not rely on the black pixel assumption. This algorithm uses pseudo-invariant features (PIF) from the image, ground-truth data, and water-leaving reflectances from an in-water radiative transfer model (Hidrolight) to determine reflectance and radiance values of the bright and dark pixels used in the ELM method.  We compare the results with in situ remote sensing reflectance measurements for different water bodies that exhibit a range of optical properties. We calculate reflectance errors for each band taking the in situ data as ground-truth, and then compare them to results from standard atmospheric correction algorithms. These reflectance errors are small in all the visible bands for a wide range of concentrations. These results show that our atmospheric correction algorithm allows one to use Landsat 8 to study Case 2 waters as an alternative to traditional ocean color satellites (e.g. MODIS, SeaWiFS).

\subsection{Satellite Data}
The Landsat 8 satellite was launched in February of 2013 as a joint initiative between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and NASA. Two push-broom instruments are onboard the Landsat 8 satellite: the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS). The satellite has a 16-day repeat cycle with a scene size of 170 km north-south by 183 km east-west. The instrument of interest in this study is OLI. OLI is a optical sensor with a total of nine bands; four bands in the visible (band 1-4), one near infrared (NIR) band (band 5), two short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands (band 6-7), one panchromatic band (band 8) and one NIR band for the detection of cirrus clouds (band 9). Landsat 8 has a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and two new bands (band 1 and band 9) compared with its predecessors (e.g. Landsat 7’s ETM+ sensor). The specification of te OLI's bands are shown in \autoref{tab:L8specs}. The Landsat 8 image used in this study was acquired on 09-19-2013 (scene LC80160302013262LGN00). This Landsat 8 Level 1T data product was downloaded from the USGS EarthExplorer website (\url{https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/}) in GeoTIFF format. The product was in digital numbers (DNs) and was converted to spectral radiance at the sensor's aperture using the radiometric calibration parameters in the metadata file (\_MTL.txt) provided with the product.

\subsection{Study Area and Field Measurements}

The study area is the Rochester Embayment, Rochester, NY (latitude: $43^\circ18'$N and longitude: $76^\circ42'$W). \autoref{fig:RrsROIs130919} shows a portion of a Landsat 8 image including the study area. This study area was chosen because it exhibits a wide range of CPA concentrations, including some eutrophic water bodies (ponds) with high concentration of CPAs, and oligomesotrophic water bodies (Lake Ontario) with low concentration of CPAs. A field collection that includes water samples and remote-sensing reflectance ($R_{rs}$) measurements was conducted at the same time of the sensor overpass. The $R_{rs}$ measurements were performed using a SVC HR-1024i instrument\cite{SVCHR1024i} following the method described by Mobley\cite{Mobley:1999} for measuring the spectra of the downwelling irradiance $E_d$, the surface reflected sky radiance $L_s$, and the water-leaving radiance $L_w$ for each site. Then, the water samples were analyzed in the lab, following SeaWiFS protocols\cite{Mueller1995} for obtaining chlorophyll-{\it a} concentration ($C_a$) and total suspended solid concentration (TSS). \autoref{tab:Sites} shows the different site names, location and the $C_a$ and $TSS$ for each site for the collection on 09-19-2013. Note the difference in concentration levels between the ponds (i.e. LONGN, LONGS and CRANB) and the lake (i.e. ONTNS, ONTOS and ONTEX) samples.

\label{sec:atmcorr}  % \label{} allows reference to this section

\subsection{MoB-ELM}
The first atmospheric correction tested in this study was the model-based empirical line method (MoB-ELM) developed by Concha and Schott\cite{Concha2014SPIE} for Landsat 8 imagery. The MoB-ELM atmospheric correction method uses a dark and bright object from the scene to determine a linear relationship between reflectance values and radiance values. Once this relationship is determined, the radiance values in the image are converted to radiance values using this relationship. The dark pixel is obtained from the radiative transfer model Hydrolight simulating  a water pixel in the scene with known CPAs concentrations and  inherent optical properties (IOPs). The bright pixel is obtained from the Landsat 8 reflectance product from USGS over a bright object in the scene or a average of bright pixels in the scene.
