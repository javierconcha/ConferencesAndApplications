Abstract = {{Remote sensing has traditionally been used to retrieve water
   constituents by establishing a relationship between in situ measured
   quantities and image-derived products. Motivated by the dramatically
   improved potential of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM), this
   paper describes a different approach for water constituent retrieval
   where both thermal and visible spectral bands of the Enhanced Thematic
   Mapper Plus (ETM+) instrument on board Landsat-7 are utilized. In this
   effort, Landsat data is integrated with a 3D hydrodynamic model to
   obtain profiles of particles and dissolved matter in the near shore zone
   in the vicinity of two river discharges. The procedure is based upon
   performing many hydrodynamic simulations by adjusting input
   environmental/physical variables and generating Look-Up-Tables (LUTs).
   The best match, obtained using optimization, demonstrated an average
   root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 0.68 percent, i.e., 0.0068 reflectance
   units, calculated over the two river plumes. It is concluded that
   calibrating a physics-based model using the Landsat-7 imagery can
   provide a more lucid insight into the dynamics of spatially non-uniform
   waters.}},
