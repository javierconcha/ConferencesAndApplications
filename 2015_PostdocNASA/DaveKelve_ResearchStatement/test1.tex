\colchunk[1]{Here is a \ulnum{1}{block} of text that might end up being kind of long. It is usually on a \ulnum{2}{random topic}, though sometimes it is interesting. What is important is that certain sections need to be aligned with one another, and sometimes this might cause things to collide.}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A block is single continuous body, sometimes composed of smaller parts.
\item like golf, the art of the Renaissance, amoebas, or the Allegory of the Cave

\colchunk[2]{
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\item Here these paragraphs are nicely spaced side by side, but I don't need the text in column 2 to get affected by spacing in column 2, except that the top line of the comment should line line up with it's underlined section
\item Maybe
\item or other parts of the text where column 2 is longer than the space between it and the next number in column 1.
\item Sometimes I might want to align text with a box too, though if there are two numbers on a line, it is ok for the text associated with them to be stacked in the other column, but this will mean a lot of space over there
